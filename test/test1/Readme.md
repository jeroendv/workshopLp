If there is more demand then there is supply then overbooking sessions 
might be unavoidable. Here we explore the effect how the *optimal* 
solution behaves in such a case using model.9 as our problem 
description.


# case1.dat: minimizing overbooked sessions.

Setting the cost associated with a reserve choice or some unbalanced 
load to zero and only assigning a cost to an overbooking will result in 
a optimal solution where the total number of people that are overbooked 
is minimized. 

This is done in case1.dat. Running case1.sh shows that at least a 100 
people need to be overbooked to have a feasible solution.
